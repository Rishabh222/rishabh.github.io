Hi, I'm Rishabh! I'm a relentless leader at Amazon, living in Seattle.

Right now I'm a leader in the AWS Database Services Org focusing on very large databases. I love building and solving
complex projects, managing and working with talented engineers to push the technical boundaries. When you reach the edge
of the technology, that's where the real fun starts.

I am writing this blog for my daughter to read when she grows up. I'll be sharing my thoughts on both technology 
and life. I've always wondered what interesting people in my life were doing at my age, so through this blog, 
my daughter will be able to read about my experiences and journey during this time.

If you'd like to chat with me about anything you can reach me on linkedIn.
Thanks for visiting
