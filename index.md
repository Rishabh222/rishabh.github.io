Hi, I'm Rishabh! I'm a relentless leader at Amazon, living in Seattle.

Right now I'm a leader on the AWS Database Services Org focusing on very large databases. I love building and solving
complex projects, managing and working with talented engineers to push the technical boundaries. When you reach the edge
of the technology, that's where the real fun starts.

I am writing this blog so that daughter can read it when she grows up. I will be adding both my thinking toward 
tech and life. I always wondered what interesting people or people I know were doing at this age. With this blog, my 
daughter will be able to read what I was doing at that age.

If you'd like to chat to me about anything you can reach me on linkedIn.
Thanks for visiting
