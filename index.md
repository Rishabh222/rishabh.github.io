Hi, I'm Rishabh! I'm a relentless leader at Amazon, living in Seattle.

Right now I'm a leader on the AWS Database Services Org focusing on very large databases like AWS Redshift, 
EMR Compute Engine ( example - Spark ) etc at AWS. I love building and solving complex problems, managing delivery of complex projects.
