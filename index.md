Hi, I'm Rishabh! I'm a relentless leader at Amazon, living in Seattle.

Right now I'm a leader on the AWS Database Services Org focusing on very large databases like AWS Redshift, 
EMR Compute Engine ( example - Spark ) etc at AWS. In general
I will be:
- the best in distributed systems and very large databases.
- the best leader ever lived on planet earth.
